Shalini Guha Java Fullstack CipherSchools BookClubProject


In the ever-evolving landscape of the digital era, the demand for efficient and seamless book retail experiences has grown significantly.  I implemented a user-friendly project aimed at an easy experience of a next-door Book-club through the implementation of a Java Full Stack solution. 

This project leverages technologies, including Spring Boot, Thymeleaf, and MySQL, to create a strapping and user-friendly platform for laying out a diverse array of books. By adopting a Full Stack approach, we ensure that our solution addresses both the backend and front-end aspects of the book club. 

 
Objectives: - 
Efficiency: Implement a system for book club, including features such as sharing new books, adding to reading list, and removing the books.  
User-friendly: The intention was to develop an easy, calm, and visually appealing front-end interface. 

Java Full Stack refers to the utilization of Java technologies across both the frontend and backend development of a web application. It encompasses the entire spectrum of a software system, from user interface design to server-side logic and database management. In a Java Full Stack environment, the frontend is typically built using Java-based frameworks such as Spring Boot or JavaServer Faces (JSF), while the backend incorporates technologies like Spring Framework for server-side processing and MySQL or other databases for data storage. This approach allows developers to create end-to-end solutions using Java, providing consistency, maintainability, and ease of integration throughout the entire application stack. 

 

JSP (JavaServer Pages): 
JSP is a Java technology used for building dynamic web pages. It allows Java code to be embedded in HTML pages, facilitating the development of server-side logic within the presentation layer.  

Servlet: 
Servlets are Java-based server-side components that handle requests and generate dynamic responses. They extend the capabilities of web servers by providing a platform-independent way to develop web applications. 

JPA (Java Persistence API): 
JPA is a Java standard for managing relational data in Java applications. It simplifies database operations, making it easier to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on persistent entities. 

Maven Projects: 
Maven simplifies the build process by managing project dependencies, compiling source code, running tests, and packaging the application into distributable formats. It uses a declarative XML configuration file (pom.xml) to define project settings, dependencies, and build goals. 

Spring Boot: 
Spring Boot is an extension of the Spring framework that simplifies the development of Java-based applications, particularly web and microservices. It supports various configurations, including dependency injection, auto-configuration, and powerful annotations, streamlining the development process and enhancing productivity. It promotes convention over configuration and eliminates the need for extensive boilerplate code, allowing developers to create stand-alone, production-ready applications with minimal effort. 

HTML is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications. It structures content on the web, defining elements such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, and more. 
CSS is a stylesheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in HTML. It controls the layout, appearance, and style of web pages, allowing developers to separate content from design. 
JavaScript is a versatile scripting language used for adding interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages. It runs in the browser and can manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) to update content, handle events, and interact with the user.

My Reading List Service 
Home.html 
Booklist.html

MyReads.html 
MySQL database 
Interface Created: - 
This is the home page created. Localhost:8020 and localhost:8020/home which can be reached simply by clicking on ‘Home’ on the navigation bar, both land on the same page. 
Now if we click on Share Books on navigation bar, we are directed to the share books page where we can add books to the book list. 
The moment we click on Share, we get redirected to the goodReads page. 
We can also navigate there by clicking on goodReads. 
The table contains Book name, author, genre, shared by, book link and action to add the specific book to the personal reading list. 
When we click on the book icon in the book link page it takes you to the book pdf or website. 
When we click on the add button under the Add to my reading list column, we are redirected to MyReads which can also be reached by clicking on ‘MyReads’ on Nav-bar. 
We also have a search function implemented with the help of JavaScript. 
When we search something if it matches with the elements in the table, it automatically scrolls to that area.

 Learning Outcomes 
It has been a very thrilling and activating mind experience. Upon completing a study of Maven projects, I got to learn how to manage Java project builds and dependencies using Maven, streamlining the development process through convention-based practices. With a grasp of Spring Boot, I could efficiently develop Java applications, harnessing embedded web servers and leveraging Spring's powerful features, paving the way for the creation of scalable microservices. I gained a better understanding in crafting dynamic and interactive web pages, seamlessly integrating with Spring MVC and utilizing a versatile expression language. Understanding JSP, Servlets, JPA, MySQL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript equipped me to build comprehensive Java Full Stack solutions, handling both frontend and backend components.  

 

Conclusion 
In conclusion, delving into Maven projects, Spring Boot, alongside learning JSP, Servlets, JPA, MySQL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, has enriched our understanding of Java Full Stack development. This immersive journey empowered me to efficiently manage project builds, develop scalable applications with Spring Boot, and create dynamic web pages. The fusion of these technologies enables us to design end-to-end solutions, seamlessly integrating front-end and back-end components. Whatever result that I could achieve with my project was only possible because of the comprehensive learning along with various project implementations during our class hours with Cipher Schools. As I reflect on this learning experience, I would like to humbly extend my heartfelt gratitude for the wealth of knowledge gained, paving the way for continued growth and innovation for us.
